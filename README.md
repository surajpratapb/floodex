# Floodex

An interactive causal map visualizing the hidden connections behind urban and river flooding events.  
Floodex helps users intuitively explore how environmental, anthropogenic, governance, and disaster management factors contribute to complex flood-related scenarios.

## üåä Purpose

Floodex is designed to:
- Highlight the cause-and-effect relationships across multiple sectors (Urban Flooding, River Floods, Governance, Disaster Management)
- Help users trace and visualize indirect links (e.g., how technological growth can eventually lead to river floods)
- Make flood systems more understandable for researchers, students, planners, and policymakers
